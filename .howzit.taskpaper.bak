	- Topic summaries @na
		Maybe in square brackets on line after topic title, or as a blockquote. When doing a list of available topics, include its summary in the output. Ignore or specially style summary when viewing full topic.
	- Named positional arguments for topics @na
		Parenthesis after title like a function (arg1, arg2). Variables can have default values (arg1 = testing) and are available as [%var1] replacements in scripts

	New Features:
	Ideas:
		- Nested topics @maybe @na
			Allow increased header levels to nest topics within a parent
			Running/viewing a parent includes all nested subtopics
			All topics still available via search
			When reading file, set a base level from first header, then test each additional topic title to see whether it's greater than the current level. If so, change current level and begin collecting subtopics at the same level
			Howzit::Topic has a subtopic attribute, consisting of an array of Topics. Each of these Topics also has a subtopics attr. These are collected and assigned during initila reading of note file
			When read in, a topic is added to the top level build notes topic, as well as appended to its parent's subtopics if it's a higher level than the base
			just need methods to determine base level (first # match) and check the current headers level when discovering a topic (count #)
			
			no, wait. topics should read in their own children. Determine base header level, split topics at that level, then recurse each topic the same way
			include statements will need to be adjusted to allow includes as children. Multiple at symbols could indicate the level to nest at, two symbols would indicate that the include belonged to the last parent. When importing, adjust base header levels appropriately (increase 1).
